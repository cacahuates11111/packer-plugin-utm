- `target_path` (string) - The path where the UTM file should be saved
  after download. By default, it will go in the packer cache, with a hash of
  the original filename as its name.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the UTM file for the new virtual machine, without
  the file extension. Make sure VMName in UTM after import is same
  as the UTM file name, By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
  where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep
  the VM registered with UTM. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will
  not export the VM. Useful if the build output is not the resultant image,
  but created inside the VM.
