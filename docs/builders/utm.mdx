# UTM Builder (from an UTM file)

Type: `utm-utm`
Artifact BuilderId: `naveenrajm7.utm`

The UTM Packer builder is able to create
[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) virtual machines and export them in
the .utm format., starting from an existing utm file (exported virtual machine
image).

The builder builds a virtual machine by importing an existing utm file.
It then boots this image, runs provisioners on this new VM, and exports that VM
to create the image. The imported machine is deleted prior to finishing the
build.

<!--
  A basic example on the usage of the builder. Multiple examples
  can be provided to highlight various build configurations.
-->
### Basic Example

Here is a basic example. This example is functional if you have an UTM matching
the settings here.

```hcl
source "utm-utm" "basic-example" {
  source_path = "source.utm"
  vm_name = "source"
  ssh_username = "packer"
  ssh_password = "packer"
  shutdown_command = "echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now"
}

build {
  sources = [ "source.utm-utm.basic-example" ]
}
```

It is important to add a `shutdown_command`. By default Packer halts the virtual
machine and the file system may not be sync'd. Thus, changes made in a
provisioner might not be saved.
